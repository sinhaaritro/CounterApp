# CounterApp
A basic Counter App made with html, css and js

A basic Counter App made with html, css and js. The tailwind css is just the base file that can be produced from npm without any extra function. Trying out DOM manipulation, local storage and probably PWA.

##Short Term Goals:

- Counter add or delete
- Counter search
- Counter value change on tap


##Long Term Goal:

- Storage

- Google Drive API to store data

- PWA
